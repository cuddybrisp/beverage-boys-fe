## Planning Story

Timing plan: wanting to start with my backend, because i have curl scripts already fleshed out that can be tested through the terminal, and i have that example schema to grow from, then move on to my auth steps and begin putting together my HTML for the forms that can be filled by the user. And keep styling from there. Will use my new knowledge of handlebars, as well as Promises and models in the backend.

### User Stories

- As a user I want to sign in/up
- As a user I want to Create a new Snack & Beverage
- As a user I want to Read multiple Snacks &Beverages I've (drank, drinking)
- As a user I want to Read a single Snack & Bevereage
- As a user I want to Update a Snack & Beverage I own (maybe finished it, went flat?)
- As a user I want to Delete a Snack & Beverage I own

### Technologies Used

- jQuery
- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap
- Javascript
- Handlebars

### Unsolved Problems

- Still need to add some styling to make the UX more appealing, and get a better understanding of the technologies used here.
- Would like to eventually be able to calculate the contents of your drinks to see if you're staying hydrated.
